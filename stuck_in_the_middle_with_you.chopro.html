{t:Stuck In The Middle With You}
{st:Stealers Wheel}

[D]Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
[D]I got the feelin' that something ain't right.
I'm so [G7]scared in case I fall off my chair
[D]And I'm wonderin' how I'll get down the stairs.
[A]Clowns to the left of me, [C]jokers to the right,
here I [D]am stuck in the middle with you.

[D]Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
[D]And I'm wonderin' what it is I should do.
It's so [G7]hard to keep this smile from my face
[D]Losing control, yeah I'm all over the place.
[A]Clowns to the left of me, [C]jokers to the right,
here I [D]am stuck in the middle with you.

Bridge:
Well you [G7]started out with nothin' and you're
proud that you're a self-made [D]man.
And your [G7]friends they all come crawlin',
slap you on the back and say
[D]Please... [A7?]Please...

{colb}
[D]Tryin' to make some sense of it all,
[D]but I can see it makes no sense at all.
Is it [G7]cool to go to sleep on the floor,
[D]'cause I don't think I can take anymore.
[A]Clowns to the left of me, [C]jokers to the right,
here I [D]am stuck in the middle with you.

Bridge:
Well you [G7]started out with nothin' and you're
proud that you're a self-made [D]man.
And your [G7]friends they all come crawlin',
slap you on the back and say
[D]Please... [A7?]Please...
