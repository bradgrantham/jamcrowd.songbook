[F#m]Two jumps in a week, I bet you th[A]ink that's pretty clever don't [E]you boy?
[F#m]Flying on your motorcycle, [A]watching all the ground beneath [E]you drop 
[F#m]You'd kill yourself for recognition, [A]kill yourself to never, [E]ever stop  [E]
[F#m]You broke another mirror, you're [A]turning into something you [E]are not


[E]Don't leave me [F\#m]high, [A] don't leave me [E]dry 
[E]Don't leave me [F\#m]high, [A] don't leave me [E]dry

[F#m]Drying up in conversation, [A]you'll be the one who can[E]not talk 
[F#m]All your insides fall to pieces, [A]you just sit there wishing you could still [E]make love
[F#m]They're the ones who'll hate you when you [A]think you've got the world all [E]sussed out
[F#m]They're the ones who'll spit on you, [A]you will be the one [E]screaming out 

[E]Don't leave me [F#m]high, [A] don't leave me [E]dry 
[E]Don't leave me [F#m]high, [A] don't leave me [E]dry 

Guitar solo:

Oh, it's the [F#m]best thing that you ever had, the [A]best thing that you ever, e[E]ver had. 
It's the [F#m]best thing that you ever had, the [A]best thing you have had has go[E]ne away. 

So don't leave me [F#m]high, [A] don't leave me [E]dry 
Don't leave me [F#m]high, [A] don't leave me [E]dry 
Don't leave me [F#m]high, [A] (guitar solo)
Don't leave me [F#m]high, [A] don't leave me [E]dry
