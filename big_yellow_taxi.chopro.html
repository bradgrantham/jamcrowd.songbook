{t:Big Yellow Taxi}
{st:Joni Mitchell}

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot.
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot.
Don't it always seem to go,
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone.
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot.

They took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum.
And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
Don't it always seem to go,
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone.
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot.

Hey farmer, farmer, put away that DDT now.
Gimme spots on my apples but give me the birds and the bees (pleease!)
Don't it always seem to go,
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone.
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot.

Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man.
Don't it always seem to go,
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone.
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot.

(I said) Don't it always seem to go,
that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone.
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot.
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot.
(high)They paved paradise, (low)put up a parking lot.
