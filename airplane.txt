if i did wrong i won't do it again

i can be sweet and good and nice
and if i had enemies they're friends
i hold onto my life with the grip of a vice

up on the airplane
nearer my god to thee
i start making a deal
inspired by gravity

that little spot on the ground is my hometown
i like to call it my home
and it's sweet
i'd rather take a seat down there
than a throne up here
up above 30,000 feet

and i'm up on the airplane
i never should've read my horoscope
or the fortune on the bubble gum strip
saying what you think won't happen will
great thing to read before a trip

on an airplane

pilot says the big blue sky's like a swimming pool
big fluffy clouds like a feather bed
i'd rather have a real pillow underneath my head
lying in my bed which is in my hometown
which is on the ground

far from an airplane
far from an airplane
up on the airplane
up on the (i'll be making a deal)
up on the (i'll be making a deal)
up on the (i'll be making a deal)
